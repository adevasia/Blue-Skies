# Blue-Skies
 A mobile application that gives the current weather conditions for a list of cities 

## How to load and run:
Open Android Studio and create a project.
The device should be set to Google Pixel 2 running Oreo 8.0. Once, the src folder is
loaded on the Studio the user can run the program by clicking on the "Run" button.

A successful build will cause the emulator/device to run. Once the Emulator is up, the user 
can scroll through a list of cities and tap on a city of their choice. The screen will 
change to display the current temeperature and summary of that city. The details of the 
city is provided by a Web API, DarkSky. To choose a different city in portrait mode, the 
user must press the back button on the emulator/device to return the list of cities. The device 
has a landscape portrait option, where the user can see both the list of cities and the details
of the chosen city at the same time.
